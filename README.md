# Wildfire Paperless Restaurant Ordering System

## 4.4 - Order Discount Feature

On the **counter** view, each order has a button that lets the cashier apply a discount to the order. The cashier has to click the button, enter a numerical value to apply a discount. E.g. Inputting 20 applies a 20% discount. This effects the price of the whole order and the discount is saved in the database.
